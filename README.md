# Sanket Muchhala — Portfolio

Welcome to my personal corner of the internet!  
This site is where I share my journey, ideas, and experiments in **data science**, **AI engineering**, and **technology** — but it’s not just about code. It’s a space to showcase the things I’m passionate about, from building intelligent systems to exploring creative, practical uses of AI.

## About Me
I’m a Data Science graduate from **Indiana University Bloomington** with a deep interest in:
- **AI & Machine Learning** — building and scaling intelligent systems.
- **Full-Stack Development** — from backend logic to clean, functional frontends.
- **Data Visualization** — turning complex datasets into something you *want* to look at.
- **Product Thinking** — not just making things work, but making them useful.

When I’m not coding, I’m usually:
- Experimenting with new AI tools and frameworks.
- Writing about technology in a way that makes sense for everyone.
- Tinkering with projects that merge data, design, and storytelling.

## About the Site
This portfolio is more than just a resume — it’s a living project:
- **Clean & Minimal UI** with a subtle animated background (Ribbon.js).
- A place where I post blogs, updates, and side projects.
- Built to reflect my style: **practical, simple, and evolving**.

Feel free to look around, and if something catches your eye, let’s connect.
