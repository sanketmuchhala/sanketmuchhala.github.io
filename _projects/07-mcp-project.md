## AI Technologies Used

This project leverages several AI technologies and tools to accelerate development and improve functionality:

- **DeepSeek AI API:** Primary AI engine for semantic understanding and response generation
- **Claude Desktop:** Used for code review, debugging, and architectural guidance
- **Claude Code CLI:** Assisted with code generation, refactoring, and optimization
- **AI-Powered Development:** Leveraged AI tools for rapid prototyping and iterative improvement

## Implementation Details

### AI Integration Strategy
The system uses DeepSeek's API as the primary AI engine due to its cost-effectiveness and powerful capabilities. The integration is designed with abstraction layers to allow easy switching between different AI providers in the future.

### Form Analysis Pipeline
1. HTML forms are parsed to extract field structure and requirements
2. Field types and constraints are identified using pattern matching
3. AI analyzes field context and determines optimal mapping strategies
4. Confidence scores are calculated for each field match

### Response Generation Process
1. Job context and requirements are analyzed by AI
2. User profile data is retrieved and formatted
3. Contextual responses are generated based on job-specific requirements
4. Responses are validated and optimized for form constraints

## Cost Optimization Strategy

One of the key innovations of this project is its focus on cost-effective AI usage. The system operates at significantly lower costs compared to traditional AI services:

- **Input Processing:** $0.14 per 1M tokens
- **Output Generation:** $0.28 per 1M tokens
- **Typical Form Analysis:** $0.01-0.03 per application
- **Monthly Usage (100 apps):** Approximately $3.00
